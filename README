The CEIC organization for computer science students in the Simon Bolivar University, organizes a soccer league called "PROPRO". 

This system was created in September 2009 so that we could organize the teams and schedule the games.

I did this webpage when I was a Student Sports Coordinator for the CEIC Organization 2009-10 in the Simon Bolivar University, in Caracas, Venezuela.
